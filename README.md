# Number-to-Words-Converter-
Overview: Developed a robust and efficient "Number to Words Converter" application in Python, leveraging a singleton class design pattern to ensure optimal memory usage and performance. This application converts numerical inputs into their corresponding English word representations, handling numbers from single digits up to crores. The project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, design patterns, and error handling.

Key Features: Singleton Design Pattern: Implemented to ensure only one instance of the number-to-words converter class exists, enhancing memory management and preventing unnecessary duplication of resources. Static Methods for Conversion: Utilized static methods for converting numbers, ensuring encapsulation and preventing external access to these methods. Comprehensive Number Range Handling: Capable of converting numbers from 0 to several crores, with special handling for different numerical ranges: Numbers less than 100 Numbers in hundreds, thousands, lakhs, and crores Exception Handling: Incorporated robust error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully, providing user-friendly messages. Technical Details: Singleton Implementation: Ensured a single instance of the num_to_words class using the new method. Dictionary Utilization: Employed a dictionary (words) to store and retrieve word representations of numbers for efficient lookup. Static Methods: _lessthanhundred: Converts numbers less than 100. _greaterthanhundred: Converts numbers in the range of hundreds. _greaterthanthousand: Converts numbers in thousands, lakhs, and crores based on the provided unit. Fasade Pattern: Created a facade class fasade_numtowords to provide a simplified interface for the conversion process, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

Outcome: This project showcases my ability to design and implement complex logic in Python, utilize advanced programming patterns, and manage error handling effectively. The application is user-friendly and efficient, demonstrating practical skills in software development and design.
